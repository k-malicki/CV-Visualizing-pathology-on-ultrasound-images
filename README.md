### Visualizing pathology on ultrasound images
In this project I use basic computer vision operations to detect and measure pathology on ultrasound image.
This project was inspired by an article on [Omdena](https://omdena.com/blog/pathology-streamlit/)

### Conclusion/Reflection
To achieve higher precision, it would be possible to train the neural network, which would significantly increase the accuracy of the measurements.
